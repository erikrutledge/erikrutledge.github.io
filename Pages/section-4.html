      <p>Website</p>

      <p class="body-text"> I’m not sure if it’s clear when looking at this website, but every page, link, animation font, color, screenshot, and more were created by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even the hosting of this website is through GitHub pages meaning no paid services or fancy external libraries were used at all, just vanilla web design. As someone who likes to learn everything I can when it comes to software development, I couldn’t bring myself to use a template because I wanted to know that I could do it myself. </p>

      <p class="body-text"> All of the pages and their elements were written in HTML, the styling was done in CSS, and all the page scripting was done in JavaScript.
