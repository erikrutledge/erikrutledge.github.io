      <p class="body-text"> This project is a fully functional clone of the NES Dr Mario game made in Python using the Pygame library. I started this project thinking it wouldn't be too difficult to adapt a tetris project I had made in the past, but I quickly learned that this was a much more interesting challenge. If you'd like to see the game running, watch the video above for a commentated walkthrough of the project! </p>
