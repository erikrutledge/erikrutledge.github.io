      <p>AID EHD</p>
      <p class="body-text">The idea for Aid EHD came from my wife. When I told her I wanted to create an app using the new Swift language I was learning she said, “it would be nice if I had an app that could remind me what I’m supposed to be doing so I don’t get so distracted.” I thought this was an interesting challenge, so I did the research, and this is what I came up with.  </p>

      <p class="body-text">I chose the name Aid EHD because the goal of the app is to help those who have ADHD brain and get distracted before they finish their tasks, like my wife. The app itself is very simple in design and just has a text field, 2 sliders and a button. The idea is that when the user knows they have a task that needs to get done they can open the app and type in what they need to do, for example “Get your homework done!” Then they move the first slider to reflect how long the task should take, maybe 2 hours. Then the last slider allows them to adjust how often they would like to be reminded. After all the information is input, they can press the “Start Focusing” button to schedule notifications every set amount of time for the course of their task.  </p>

      <p class="body-text"> I enjoyed writing this project especially because I could see this being used practically by a lot of people. It was also great to work in XCode on this project because of all the simulation tools it provides. I was able to create a simulation of the exact model phone I planned to run the app on and could see changes made in real time. This isn’t something new, but for someone who mainly works in Python or C++ it was really neat. Above is a screenshot of the development environment showing the simulation I just talked about, and below is an example of what the notifications would look like on your phone.</p>

      <p class="body-text"> The app is not currently on the Appstore, but I do plan on fixing some bugs, changing a few of the design elements, and doing a full release eventually.
