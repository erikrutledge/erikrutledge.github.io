      <p>PokeAPI Web Tool</p>

      <p class="body-text"> This project was made to practice using APIs and dynamically update a website based on the user's input and randomly generated numbers. There were a few challenges I had to overcome for this project, but itâ€™s one of my favorite because of the simplicity. The entire website is visible on arrival and just has a dropdown menu and a button. Click on this first image or right <a href="PokeAPI.html">here</a> to try it out!</p>

      <p class="body-text"> I was inspired to make this silly tool when I found pokeapi.co and started to brainstorm ways I could use it. It was my first attempt to draw information from these large data sets using JavaScript and I found it very enjoyable. I added the ability to select which generation of Pokemon the user wanted to draw from, but this hasn't been updated to the newest version quite yet.</p>

      <p class="body-text"> I was very pleased with how the project turned out, especially with how concise I was able to make the logic in the JavaScript file.
