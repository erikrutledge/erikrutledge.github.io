## Personal Website - Overview
---
For the creation of my personal website, I made a homepage called "index.html" with a moving track of pictures that link to invividual projects when clicked on. The purpose of this project is to have a single location showing off previous projects that I can link in my resume. It's one thing to say, "I know Python, C++, Swift, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more," but if I were to have all my projects grouped together that a future employer can explore they would be able to see exactly how much I do or don't know 


## Project Structure 
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```

+-- README.md           
+-- Pages                   
    +-- index.html          
    +-- section-1.html      
    +-- section-2.html      
    +-- section-3.html      
    +-- section-4.html      
    +-- section-5.html     
    +-- coming-soon.html   
    +-- contact.html        
+-- Scripting

## Development Environment
---
The project was written in VS Code for mac using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
---
- I plan to update the website each time I complete a project. I made the webpage with scalability in mind.
- Adding more JavaScript effects would be nice. Smoothing out some quirks and adding interest.
- I wanted to add gifs to explain the old projects, but ran out of time researching it and settled with just pictures, which works, but I'd like to go back to add some video elements.
