      <p>Terminal Greed</p>
      <p class="body-text"> You may have noticed from my previous projects that I enjoy puns as names for the projects, and this one is no different. Terminal Greed is a 2-player game that runs in the console command line, also known as the terminal. The game is all about the temptation of taking money, but like the title warns, greed is a terminal illness, and it will kill you. </p>
      <p class="body-text"> The game takes turns and alternates play between the 2 players. To begin, both players enter their names then they are shown a random amount of money placed into the center pool that they can try to steal. Starting with player 1 the game will ask if they want to steal the money or leave it. After locking in their decision the console is cleared so player 2 doesn’t see their answer before making their own decision with the same options. If one of the players choose to steal and the other passes, the player that stole walks away with the money. The catch is if both players try to steal neither of them get it and they are deducted money from their wallets equal to the money they tried to steal. If you ever run out of money you lose! </p>

      <p class="body-text"> The most compelling part of this game is the mind tricks you can play on your opponent because the better you know them, the more money you can walk away with. The money isn’t pointless either because if you accumulate more than $100 you can spend it on an extra life. Play continues until, like Monopoly, one person is rich and the other is left with nothing.</p>

      <p class="body-text"> Even though terminal, or command line, games are pretty outdated and are limited in their capabilities, I really enjoyed thinking creatively to balance a fun game that focuses less on the technology and more on the human interaction. As you can see in these screenshots the game itself is just text but is very enjoyable to play.</p>
